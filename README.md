# Improving Neural Machine Translation using Instruction Tuning

This work is a part of my Master's Thesis under Prof. Pawan Goyal. 

Following work has been done till now:
1. Training FLAN T5 7B on our translation dataset.
2. Pretraining LLama on Low Resource Indian Languages (using ALMA)
3. Code set up for Meta Training with MetaICL

### Note
The work is still in progress hence the code uploaded is not complete. The complete code with the results will be updated soon.
